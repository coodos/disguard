# Disguard: A bot to rule them all

## Introduction

DisGuard is a **moderation** bot which is a result of my obsession with linux and linux commands.

The idea is that everyone in the server would have an equal role with no difference between mods and regular users visible to a regular user. This would make the users behave as they would in a normal conversation and not how they would thinking someone is constantly moderating them.

Whenever moderation is needed, a mod or an admin who has the 'sudoers' role can execute `$su` to get the privileges required for moderation and will be displayed seprately.

### How it is linked to linux

This is bot is based on the principle of linux. The way linux has every user as a standard user and the system admin is no different and whenever the system admin wants to run any command which requires higher privledges they can get into root with `$su`, the same way you can get the highest privledges after running `$su` else, everyone's a normal user.

To prevent any normal user from accessing root, 'sudo' has a sudoers file where the users who can access sudo are mentioned, the same way, you give sudoers role to the people who can access the `$su` command.
